# Parallel-implementation-of-Submatrix-Search-Final-project
This project is aimed at developing a simplified recognition algorithm for identifying objects in each given picture with an appropriate matching value. The program takes a set of pictures and a set of objects, and searches for three different objects in each picture. The output includes the list of objects found in each picture.
