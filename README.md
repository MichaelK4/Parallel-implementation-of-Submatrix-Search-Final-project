# Parallel-implementation-of-Submatrix-Search-Final-project
This project is aimed at developing a simplified recognition algorithm for identifying objects in each given picture with an appropriate matching value. The program takes a set of pictures and a set of objects, and searches for three different objects in each picture. The output includes the list of objects found in each picture.

# The program runs on the Linux operating system.

# To use the program in the terminal do
To compile the code write in the terminal: make all

To run the program write in the terminal: make run

To clear all write in the terminal: make clean

Works for both the sequential solution and the parallel solution.

# The parallelization
The parallelization uses MPI and OpenMP, with MPI dividing the work on the pictures between two processes
and OpenMP was used to assign each thread to process a subset of pictures and to execute multiple iterations of a loop in parallel.
Each process recived two threads.

Overall with the sequential solution under Linux operating system with 4 cores runs on avg about 32.5 seconds and the parallel solution for about 17.6 seconds.
